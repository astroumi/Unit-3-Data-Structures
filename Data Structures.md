# Data Structures

## Matrices
- A matrix is basically a 2 dimensional array
- There is matrix data structure, so we use a multiple lists within a list

```python
matrix_A = [
    [1, 2, 3, 4],
    [5, 6, 7, 8]
]

# Accessing Matrix A
print('Row 1: %s' % matrix_A[0]) # Recall: Indexing starts at zero in Python
print('Value at Row 2 Column 2: %s' % matrix_A[1][1])
```

### Rules
- All rows must have the same number of values
- All columns must have the same number of values
- All items in the 2D List must have the same data types
- Since indexing always starts at 0 ... row 1 is technically located at matrix_A[0]
